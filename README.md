Weâ€™ve decided to configure it without XML documents, using annotations.  Spring Data JPA was chosen to store and retrieve data in a relational database, because this framework is flexible enough for our tasks, it makes code easy to read and elegant.  Authentication was implemented by configuring Spring Security. We used Apache Tomcat 8 as a web server, iText framework for dynamic creating of PDF reports.
We used basic tools of Twitter Bootstrap with JavaScript for the front-end development.

Don't judge me too harshly
